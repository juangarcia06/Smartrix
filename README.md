# Smartrix Clock

## Design

Smartrix is inspired from the "La metric time" clock. I designed it over some weeks and have fully printed it. The software isn't done at the moment, but I am working on it.

Smartrix uses 4 8x8 led grid displays connected to a esp8266. I also used a micro usb port with a capacitor to prevent burning the leds with an overcharge, it is highly recommended.
